Amazon has:
	Items
	Buyers
	Sellers
	Account Info (address, Credit Card, etc.)
	Tracking Info 
	Shopping Cart
	Departments
	Categories
We could want to store
	Items in a cart
	Items in a category/Department
	Payment Information
	Shipping Information
	Prime eligible information
	Items that have been purchased
Users, Items, Payment Info, Shipping Info, Categories can all be created
All can be read?
Payment, Shipping, Categories can be updated.
All can be deleted.
Users have name, payment/shipping info
cart has items
user has cart
Items have:
prices
categories
descriptions
sellers
For now, its probably best to create a user, an item, and a shopping cart.
It may be better to have an item id that is used across categories, carts, etc.
I'm also not sure how to integrate carts with users, etc.
